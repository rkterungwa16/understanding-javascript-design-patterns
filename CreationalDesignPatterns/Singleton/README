Singleton

  A class of which only a single instance can exist

  Single occurrence of an object throughout the application
  life.

  Example Use cases for singletons
    Configuration manager
    Cache manager
    Log manager
    Database connection pool: The pool manages the creation,
    destruction, and lifetime of all database connections for
    the entire application

  Caution:
    Use singletons with care since they are global variables.
    Poor usage can risk polluting the global environment.

  Singleton object provides a global point of access to
  itself

  Only one instance of the object must exist

  Creating Singletons
    Using Literal Notation
      it can be accessed everywhere in the application if
      created in a global context

    Disadvantages
      We are not sure that this object will be used during
      the application life.
        If a particular execution flow of the application does
        not use our object, we unnecessarily waste the
        system's resources.

      If our Singleton object has to manage internal state,
      using literal notation is not the best way.
